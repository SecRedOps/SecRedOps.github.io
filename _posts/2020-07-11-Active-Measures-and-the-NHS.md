#### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
<figure class="half">
    <a href="/assets/images/image-filename-1-large.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/image-filename-1.jpg"></a>
    <a href="/assets/images/image-filename-2-large.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/image-filename-2.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="https://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG"><img src="https://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<a href="https://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg"><img src="https://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
<figure class="third">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<img src="https://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="https://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="https://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<figcaption>Three images.</figcaption>
