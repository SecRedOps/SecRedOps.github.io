#### Fake Messages 

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="/assets/images/photo_2020-03-30_11-00-25.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/photo_2020-03-30_11-00-25.jpg"></a>
	<a href="/assets/images/photo_2020-04-01_14-06-39.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/photo_2020-04-01_14-06-39.jpg"></a>

#### Persons Identified Spreading Fakes

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

```html
<figure class="third">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">

	<img src="https://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
